# Project Description

This project is a **Fitness Tracker** that uses the **Nutritionix API** to estimate the calories burned for various exercises. The user can input the type of exercise and its duration in natural language, and the program will calculate the estimated calories burned. The program can also take into account user demographics like age, gender, and weight to make a more accurate estimate.

The program is interactive and prompts the user for their exercise information. It then sends this information to the Nutritionix API, which returns data about the exercise, including the estimated calories burned.

But the functionality doesn't stop there! Once the program has the exercise data, it then uses the **Sheety API** to record this data in a Google Sheets document. This allows the user to keep a record of their workouts and the estimated calories burned, providing a simple and effective way to track their fitness progress over time.

Here's a brief overview of how the program works:

1. The program prompts the user for the exercise they did and for how long.
2. It sends this information to the Nutritionix API, which returns data about the exercise, including the estimated calories burned.
3. The program then formats this data and sends it to a Google Sheets document via the Sheety API.
4. The user can then view their Google Sheets document to see a record of their workouts and the estimated calories burned.

This project demonstrates the power of APIs and how they can be used to create practical and useful applications. Whether you're a fitness enthusiast looking to track your progress, or a developer interested in working with APIs, this project has something for you. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
